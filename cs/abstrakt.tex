The study of RNA is important to better understand evolution or some
diseases. In this thesis, we present a library written in Typescript that
offers methods for visual analysis of multiple RNA secondary structures, but
preferably work best with two or three structures. For the representation we
use radial diagram, which is generated by template-based method. Methods used
in the library for analysis use the template-based generation of the radial
diagram by mapping diagrams generated from the same template to each other via
the template, so that differences and similarities of structures can be
observed.
