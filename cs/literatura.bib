This led us to the idea to use existing layouts as templates for the visualization of new RNAs similarly to how templates are used in homology-based structure prediction.},

    abstract={Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are essential for all life, and their functions often depend on their secondary (2D) and tertiary structure. Despite the abundance of software for the visualisation of ncRNAs, few automatically generate consistent and recognisable 2D layouts, which makes it challenging for users to construct, compare and analyse structures. Here, we present R2DT, a method for predicting and visualising a wide range of RNA structures in standardised layouts. R2DT is based on a library of 3,647 templates representing the majority of known structured RNAs. R2DT has been applied to ncRNA sequences from the RNAcentral database and produced >13 million diagrams, creating the world's largest RNA 2D structure dataset. The software is amenable to community expansion, and is freely available at https://github.com/rnacentral/R2DTand a web server is found at https://rnacentral.org/r2dt.},

    abstract = "DESCRIPTION: VARNA is a tool for the automated drawing,
    visualization and annotation of the secondary structure of RNA,
    designed as a companion software for web servers and databases.
    FEATURES: VARNA implements four drawing algorithms, supports
    input/output using the classic formats dbn, ct, bpseq and RNAML
    and exports the drawing as five picture formats, either
    pixel-based (JPEG, PNG) or vector-based (SVG, EPS and XFIG). It
    also allows manual modification and structural annotation of the
    resulting drawing using either an interactive point and click
    approach, within a web server or through command-line arguments.
    AVAILABILITY: VARNA is a free software, released under the terms
    of the GPLv3.0 license and available at http://varna.lri.fr.
    SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at

Current approaches to visualizing secondary structure provide an adequate platform for the conversion of static text-based representations to 2D images, but are limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures, multiple structures and pseudoknotted structures.Results: In this article, we present forna, a web-based tool for displaying RNA secondary structure which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary structures to clean, concise and customizable visualizations. It supports, among other features, the simultaneous visualization of multiple structures, the display of pseudoknotted structures, the interactive editing of the displayed structures, and the automatic generation of secondary structure diagrams from PDB files. It requires no software installation apart from a modern web browser.Availability and implementation: The web interface of forna is available at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/forna while the source code is available on github at www.github.com/pkerpedjiev/forna.Contact:  pkerp@tbi.univie.ac.atSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}",

    abstract = "{ Visually examining RNA structures can greatly aid in understanding their potential functional roles and in evaluating the performance of structure prediction algorithms. As many functional roles of RNA structures can already be studied given the secondary structure of the RNA, various methods have been devised for visualizing RNA secondary structures. Most of these methods depict a given RNA secondary structure as a planar graph consisting of base-paired stems interconnected by roundish loops. In this article, we present an alternative method of depicting RNA secondary structure as arc diagrams. This is well suited for structures that are difficult or impossible to represent as planar stem-loop diagrams. Arc diagrams can intuitively display pseudo-knotted structures, as well as transient and alternative structural features. In addition, they facilitate the comparison of known and predicted RNA secondary structures. An added benefit is that structure information can be displayed in conjunction with a corresponding multiple sequence alignments, thereby highlighting structure and primary sequence conservation and variation. We have implemented the visualization algorithm as a web server R- chie as well as a corresponding R package called R4RNA, which allows users to run the software locally and across a range of common operating systems. }",
