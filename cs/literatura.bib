R2DT is based on a library of 3,647 templates representing the majority of known structured RNAs. R2DT has been applied to ncRNA sequences from the RNAcentral database and produced >13 million diagrams, creating the world's largest RNA 2D structure dataset.

Current approaches to visualizing secondary structure provide an adequate platform for the conversion of static text-based representations to 2D images, but are limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures, multiple structures and pseudoknotted structures.Results: In this article, we present forna, a web-based tool for displaying RNA secondary structure which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary structures to clean, concise and customizable visualizations. It supports, among other features, the simultaneous visualization of multiple structures, the display of pseudoknotted structures, the interactive editing of the displayed structures, and the automatic generation of secondary structure diagrams from PDB files.

As many functional roles of RNA structures can already be studied given the secondary structure of the RNA, various methods have been devised for visualizing RNA secondary structures. Most of these methods depict a given RNA secondary structure as a planar graph consisting of base-paired stems interconnected by roundish loops. In this article, we present an alternative method of depicting RNA secondary structure as arc diagrams. This is well suited for structures that are difficult or impossible to represent as planar stem-loop diagrams. Arc diagrams can intuitively display pseudo-knotted structures, as well as transient and alternative structural features. In addition, they facilitate the comparison of known and predicted RNA secondary structures. An added benefit is that structure information can be displayed in conjunction with a corresponding multiple sequence alignments, thereby highlighting structure and primary sequence conservation and variation. We have implemented the visualization algorithm as a web server R- chie as well as a corresponding R package called R4RNA, which allows users to run the software locally and across a range of common operating systems. }",

    abstract = {Despite many advances in diagnosis and therapy (surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy), cancer remains one of the most important public health problems worldwide. Every day, the role of exosomes in cancer development and metastasis is being better described. Liquid biopsy was developed for early detection of cancer through minimally invasive and serial examinations of body fluids, with the advantage of tracking tumor progression in real time. Exosomes are extracellular membrane vesicles with a diameter of 30–100 nm, which are secreted by various types of cells and are present in most biological fluids. For a long time, they were considered non-functional cellular components, and today it has already been proven that they are a means of intercellular information exchange. They can move bioactive molecules such as proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA. Several studies have shown that their contents, including proteins and noncoding nucleic acids, may be of particular interest as biomarkers of diseases. The vast majority of gene transcripts are actually characterized as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and are clusters of RNAs that do not encode functional proteins. They can be small, about 20 nucleotides in length, and are known as microRNAs (miRNAs), or transcripts over 200 nucleotides in length, defined as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are a large group of ncRNAs over 200 nucleotides in length. LncRNAs, as regulatory factors, play an important role in complex cellular processes such as apoptosis, growth, differentiation, proliferation, etc. Recently, the results of many studies have also shown their essential role in carcinogenesis. Endogenous lncRNAs can be secreted by tumor cells into human biological fluids in the form of microvesicles, exosomes, or protein complexes, thereby forming circulating lncRNAs that are not degraded by RNA and are in a stable state. Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been observed in cancer patients. In this context, endogenous lncRNAs can regulate the basic characteristics of cancer cells by controlling the expression of oncogenes associated with their suppressive and oncogenic functions. Therefore, circulating lncRNAs can be excellent biomarkers in cancer as well. This paper provides an overview of current research on the functional role of lncRNAs in cancer and their potential clinical applications as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancer.}

Recurrence of primary tumor and metastasis to distant body parts are major causes of breast cancer-associated mortality. The 5-year survival rate for women with metastatic breast cancer is only 25–30%. Breast cancer metastasis is a series of processes involved with EMT, invasion, loss of cell to cell adhesion, alteration in cell phenotype, extravasation, microenvironment of the tumor, and colonization to the secondary sites. Epigenetic modification is involved in the transformation of the distant stromal cell into a secondary tumor. LncRNAs, are one the key epigenetic modifiers, are the largest endogenous non-coding RNAs with approximate base-pair lengths from 200 nt to 100 kb. LncRNA plays a crucial role in breast cancer metastasis by sponging miRNA, by degrading or silencing specific mRNA, or else by targeting the enzymes and microprocessor subunits involved in the biogenesis of miRNA. LncRNA also alters the expression of several genes involved in breast cancer metastasis and modulating different cell signaling pathways. The goal of this review is to provide a better understanding of the role of lncRNA in the regulation of breast cancer metastasis. We also summarized some of the key lncRNAs that regulate the genes and signaling pathways involved in breast cancer invasion and metastasis.}

    ABSTRACT = {Abiotic stresses triggered by climate change and human activity cause substantial agricultural and environmental problems which hamper plant growth. Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms in response to abiotic stresses, such as stress perception, epigenetic modification, and regulation of transcription and translation. Over the past decade, a large body of literature has revealed the various regulatory roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the plant response to abiotic stresses and their irreplaceable functions in environmental adaptation. LncRNAs are recognized as a class of ncRNAs that are longer than 200 nucleotides, influencing a variety of biological processes. In this review, we mainly focused on the recent progress of plant lncRNAs, outlining their features, evolution, and functions of plant lncRNAs in response to drought, low or high temperature, salt, and heavy metal stress. The approaches to characterize the function of lncRNAs and the mechanisms of how they regulate plant responses to abiotic stresses were further reviewed. Moreover, we discuss the accumulating discoveries regarding the biological functions of lncRNAs on plant stress memory as well. The present review provides updated information and directions for us to characterize the potential functions of lncRNAs in abiotic stresses in the future.},
